# Introduction

Herein lies the data analysis for the paper "Extreme Weather Events: Perception, Pro-Environmental Behavior, and the Tools to Measure Them". Raw files are initially cleaned and excluded in the [REBL repository](https://github.com/tshrum/rebl). Here, we take those files and run some extra cleaning, exploratory factor analysis, data imputation, structural equation modeling, and report outputs for use in the paper.
