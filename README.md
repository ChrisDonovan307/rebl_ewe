# Introduction

Herein lies the data analysis for the paper “Extreme Weather Events:
Perception, Pro-Environmental Behavior, and the Tools to Measure Them”.
Raw files are initially cleaned and excluded in the [REBL
repository](https://github.com/tshrum/rebl). Here, we take those files
and run some extra cleaning, exploratory factor analysis, data
imputation, structural equation modeling, and report outputs for use in
the paper.
